<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asthma and COPD Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inhaler</li><li>Nebulizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The asthma and COPD devices market primarily includes inhalers and nebulizers. Inhalers, such as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), deliver medication directly to the lungs in a portable, user-friendly form, ideal for managing symptoms. Nebulizers, on the other hand, convert liquid medication into a mist, making it easier for patients with severe respiratory issues to inhale larger doses. Both device types play crucial roles in enhancing treatment adherence and improving patient outcomes in respiratory diseases.</p></p>

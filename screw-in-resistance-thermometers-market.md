<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Screw-in Resistance Thermometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2 Wire</li><li>3 Wire</li><li>4 Wire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Screw-in resistance thermometers are available in three main configurations: 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire systems. The 2-wire type is the simplest, featuring two leads that connect directly to the measuring device but may suffer from resistance errors. The 3-wire configuration adds an additional wire to minimize errors, making it more accurate. The 4-wire design is the most precise, using separate pairs for supply and measurement, effectively eliminating resistance influences. This diversity allows users to select based on accuracy and application needs.</p></p>
